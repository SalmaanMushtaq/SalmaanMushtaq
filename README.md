I'm a **Front-End Developer** with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive, and functional web applications. I love working with modern web technologies and bringing ideas to life through code. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer, learning and experimenting with the latest frameworks and tools in the front-end world.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Building **interactive and scalable web applications** using React and Angular.
- Exploring **TypeScript** to create robust, maintainable code.
- Improving my skills in **UI/UX design** to craft user-friendly interfaces.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **Advanced React patterns** like Hooks and Context API.
- **GraphQL** for more efficient data fetching in web applications.
- **Node.js** to build full-stack applications and understand the back-end side of web development.
