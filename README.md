## 👨‍💻 About Me:
I’m a dedicated **front-end developer** with a passion for turning ideas into interactive, high-performing web applications. With a deep knowledge of **React, Angular**, and **TypeScript**, I specialize in building sleek, responsive designs that prioritize user experience and performance.

💡 I’m constantly exploring new front-end technologies to enhance my skill set and bring cutting-edge solutions to every project. My goal is to create impactful digital experiences that not only look beautiful but are functional and accessible.

🌍 When I’m not coding, I’m passionate about continuous learning, from UI/UX design to emerging web development trends. I also love sharing knowledge with fellow developers and contributing to open-source projects.


## 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On:
- Enhancing my knowledge of **Web Performance Optimization** and **Accessibility Best Practices**.
- Building engaging and scalable projects using **React** and **Angular** frameworks.
- Diving deeper into **TypeScript** and improving my expertise in front-end architecture.
